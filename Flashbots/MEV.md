# MEV-Research

## Flashbots Research Process

Flashbots Research is an open, transparent and iterative collective creation process taking inspiration from both academic and applied research, and modelled upon Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process. Anyone can contribute to Flashbots Research through opening or answering a Github issue in this repo, and/or writing a Flashbots Research Proposal (FRP) by proposing to answer a Research Question specified in the [Flashbots Research Roadmap (WIP)](research_roadmap.md), and/or create a pull request to revise a particular FRP.

#### Flashbots Research Proposals (FRPs)

FRPs stands for Flashbots Research Proposal. It is a markdown document describing the approach to answering a core Research Question specified on the [Flashbots Research Roadmap (WIP)](research_roadmap.md). Similar to a research proposal for academic writing, it entails introducing what the research proposes to do and/or prove. It should incorporate systematic breakdown of the research question. It will also give an in-depth account of the methodologies, approaches or theories that will be used to support the hypothesis within the project, including a review of the relevant literature.
Please review [FRP-0](/FRPs/FRP-0.md) for the process of creating an FRP, and [FRP-1](/FRPs/FRP-1.md) as an example FRP.
If there exists a Research Question you deem important that is not currently on the Flashbots Research Roadmap, we invite you to open an Issue in this repository and propose your specific Research Question for consideration. FRP editors will review and update the Flashbots Research Roadmap periodically.

#### Issues

If you would like to raise a new Research Question to be incorporated into the Flashbots Research Roadmap, or you are a (prospective) MEV Fellow who would like to breakdown a particular Research Question into addressable sub questions to seek community contributions, we invite you to open an Issue in this repository and link it to the relevant FRP Draft.
</br> An Issue will be closed by FRP editors if the newly proposed Research Question has been reviewed and acted upon, or a FRP has been completed, or the Issue is no longer relevant.

#### MEV Research Fellows

An MEV Research Fellow (or MEV Fellows) is a [MEV Fellowship](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/blob/main/research_fellowship.md) grant recipient whose FRP has been accepted upon review and who undertakes answering the Research Questions specified in the Flashbots Research Roadmap. In addition to delivering the FRPs, the MEV fellows, who can be either a natural person or an organization, will act as co-authors of the Flashbots research papers and are responsible for collaborating with other MEV Fellows in architecting, coordinating and delivering the Flashbots research papers and presentations.

#### MEV Research Contributors

If you are interested in contributing but do not want to commit to the responsibility of drafting and getting necessary alignment for an FRP, you can become a MEV Research Contributor (or Contributor). A Contributor is anyone who is not an MEV Fellow but contributes meaningful artifacts to FRPs that end up being included in the Flashbots research papers. Contributors can be either invited by respective MEV Fellows for particular FRP throughout its lifecycle of research, or request to join an MEV Fellow to work on a particular FRP before its review, to collaborate on a particular Research Question.
</br> Opening/answering Github Issues in this repo or creating meaningful pull requests to draft FRPs are ways to signal interest and demonstrate qualification as a Contributor. Contributors will be recognized in the papers for their contribution.

## Flashbots Research Phase I

Phase I of [Flashbots Research Roadmap (WIP)](research_roadmap.md) is considered the proof-of-concept stage of Flashbots. It consists in practical/ultra-applied research akin to 'industry' R&D, in close loop with development. We expect Flashbots developers to be heavily involved in this phase.
</br> Phase I has 2 research papers as a deliverable, the first draft of the papers will be due at the end of January, and publication targeting Q1 2021.
The outcome of Phase I is immediately relevant to providing technical and economic evaluation to the Flashbots Proof-of-Concept (PoC), and communicating our design and intentions to the community.

#### Phase I Timeline

The tentative timeline for Flashbots Research Phase I is as follows, subject to adjustment by FRP editors.

**Authorship**
</br> Our research efforts will output research papers that will be shaped by Research Fellows. Anyone (including entities) can be an author of these papers as long as they meet one of the criteria for authorship we follow, as described in the Association for Computing Machinery's [Criteria for Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/authorship), with modification to recognize contribution from anonymous authors.

## MEV Research Workshop

### Purpose

</br> Research workshop is a 60-minute weekly discussion that addresses specific research questions, Flashbots Research Proposals (FRPs) and/or open questions within the scope specified in the [Flashbots Research Roadmap (WIP)](research_roadmap.md), so to set directions for resolving open issues or specific questions that arise from research-[[Engineering]] coordination. Anyone can propose a topic to be discussed in the Research Workshop by opening a github issue in Flashbots' [/mev-research repo](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/) and/or labeling an outstanding issue "workshop", and linking it to related FRPs and github issues or research questions yet to be addressed (Example: [Issue 24](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/issues/24) on MEV taxonomy). Research workshop will be recorded and published after the call.
