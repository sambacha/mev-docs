How to navigate Flashbots:
All our efforts are documented and executed on Github, we encourage you to read through it. Anyone is welcome to comment on an issue or pick it up entirely. We use Discord as our main chat and have split the discussion between several channels, please ask your question in the relevant channel!
We run several calls that are open to the public to join: weekly research workshops, bi-weekly MEV roasts and monthly core dev calls.
