One can imagine other declinations of this strategy such as cross-asset cross-platform interest rate arbitrage (eg. between margin trading platform [DyDx](https://defitutorials.substack.com/p/margin-trading-using-dydx-exchange) and Compound) and single-asset cross-platform interest rate arbitrage. Executing a trade across lending platforms invites new considerations such as the different rate change mechanisms. (i.e. Compound has linear borrow and superlinear supply rate curves while dYdX has a superlinear borrow _and_ supply rate curve).

## **BlockFi/DyDx interest rate arbitrage**

[DyDx](https://defitutorials.substack.com/p/margin-trading-using-dydx-exchange) is an open trading platform for crypto assets where users can margin trade with up to 5x leverage, borrow and lend trustlessly. [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/) is a custodial lending platform that allows users to borrow and lend large market-cap cryptoassets such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH).
