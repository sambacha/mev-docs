###  Flashbots

Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by miner-extractable value (MEV) to smart-contract blockchains, starting with Ethereum. Our primary focus is to enable a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction. Flashbots arose out of the MEV Pi-rate Ship, a neutral, chain-agnostic, interdisciplinary research collective that supports MEV-related theoretical and empirical research.

Flashbots is committed to open source. The best way to learn about Flashbots is to follow our progress in each repo. Find out more about Flashbots organization in our medium post Flashbots: Frontrunning the MEV-crisis.

Flashbots research and development are tightly-coupled dual engines that propel Flashbots in a phased approach:

Long-term oriented research effort: They spec out and update our roadmap, define our organizationâ€™s phases and identify key milestones associated with each of them;
Milestone-oriented [[Engineering]] effort: They are organized as product-focused teams that ship core infrastructure and ecosystem tools, while collecting data and producing other artifacts that feed back into research.
